Document Listing:
The platform will have two main sections: "Found Documents" and "Lost Documents." Users can create listings in either section, providing essential details about the document without revealing sensitive information. For example, they might list "National ID found in Central Park on June 15" without giving the full ID number.

Search Functionality:
Users can search for documents using key parameters such as document type, date range, and location. The search function will match these criteria against existing listings.

Notification System:
When a user posts about a lost document, they can opt to receive notifications. If a matching document is later posted in the "Found Documents" section, the system will automatically send an email alert to the user.
